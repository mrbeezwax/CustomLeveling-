This plugin is all about implementing a simple way to have custom levels on your server. It allows you to enter a level and how much xp it will take to get there. The best part? The xp bar correctly displays the user's xp level!

I updated the plugin to be used for Minecraft 1.12+. I am not taking over the plugin. However, if I am given permission and if people want more features, I will update it and add more features.
